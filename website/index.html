<h1><a href="http://tinyclouds.org/node">Node</a></h1>

<p id="introduction">Purely event-based I/O for <a
  href="http://code.google.com/p/v8/">V8 javascript</a>. 

<p>An example of a web server written with Node which responds with
"Hello World" after waiting two seconds:

<pre>
new node.http.Server(function (req, res) {
  setTimeout(function () {
    res.sendHeader(200, [["Content-Type", "text/plain"]]);
    res.sendBody("Hello World");
    res.finish();
  }, 2000);
}).listen(8000);
puts("Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/");
</pre>

<p> To run the server, put the code into a file <code>example.js</code>
and execute it with the <code>node</code> program
<pre class="sh_none">% /usr/local/bin/node example.js
Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
</pre>

<p> See the <a href="api.html">API documentation</a> for more examples.

<p> Node's goal is to provide an easy way to build scalable network
programs.
In the above example, the 2 second delay does not prevent the server from
handling new requests.
Node tells the operating system (through 
<code>epoll</code>,
<code>kqueue</code>,
<code class="sh_none">/dev/poll</code>, 
or <code>select</code>) 
that it should be notified when the 2 seconds are up or if a new connection
is made&mdash;then it goes to sleep. If someone new connects, then it
executes the callback, if the timeout expires, it executes the inner
callback. Each connection is only a small heap allocation.

<p>This is in contrast to today's more common model
where OS threads are employed for concurrency. But thread-based networking 
<a href="http://www.sics.se/~joe/apachevsyaws.html">is</a>
<a href="http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html">relatively</a>
<a href="http://bulk.fefe.de/scalable-networking.pdf">inefficient</a>
<!-- TODO needs links -->
and 
very
difficult 
to 
use. 

<p>
Node will show much better memory efficency under high-loads 
<!-- TODO benchmark -->
than systems which allocate 2mb thread stacks for each connection.

<p>Users of Node are free from worries of dead-locking the
process&mdash;there are no locks.  In fact, there arn't even blocking
functions. Because nothing blocks, Node can be given to less-than-export
programmers to build servers.

<p>Node is similar to systems like
Ruby's <a href="http://rubyeventmachine.com/">Event Machine</a>
or
Python's <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/">Twisted</a>.
But Node takes the paradigm. 
In other systems, there is always a blocking call to start the event-loop.
Typically one sets up behavior through callbacks and at the end starts the
server through a  call like <code>EventMachine::run()</code>. In Node, 
there is no such thing. By default Node enters the event loop after
executing the input script. Node exits the event loop when there are no more
callbacks to perform. 

<p>Node's HTTP server has grown out of my difficulties developing
and working with web servers.  For example, streaming data through most web
frameworks is difficult or impossible.  Or like the oft-made false
assumption that all message headers have unique fields.  Node attempts to
correct these problems by providing a low-level but complete HTTP API.
Coupled with Node's purely evented infrastructure, it will make a solid foundation for
future frameworks.

<p> <i>But what about multiple-processor concurrency? Threads are necessary
to scale programs to multi-core computers.</i> The name <i>Node</i> should
give some hint at how it is envisioned being used.  Processes are necessary
to scale to multi-core computers, not memory-sharing threads.  The
fundamentals of scalable systems are fast networking and non-blocking
design&mdash;the rest is message passing.  In the future, I'd like Node to
to be able to spawn new processes (probably using the <a
href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-workers/current-work/">Web Workers
API</a>), but this is something that fits well into the current design.

<p>Node eventually wants to support all POSIX operating systems (including
Windows with mingw) but at the moment it is only being tested on Linux,
Macintosh, and FreeBSD.  The build system requires Python.  V8, on which
Node is built, supports only IA-32 and ARM processors. V8 is included in the
Node distribution. There are no dependencies.

./configure

make install

<p> Then have a look at the <a href="api.html">API documentation</a>.

<p>To run the tests
