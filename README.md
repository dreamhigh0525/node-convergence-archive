Node.js Foundation - Node.js
=====

This repository is the working repository for the proposed convergence of the
http://github.com/iojs/io.js and http://github.com/joyent/node projects under
the Node.js Foundation.

Contributions, releases, and contributorship are under the proposed
Governance and Developer Policy for the soon-to-be-launched Node.js
Foundation:

* https://github.com/joyent/nodejs-advisory-board/tree/master/governance-proposal
* http://github.com/jasnell/dev-policy

This project is operating with the oversight of the joint Node.js and io.js
core technical teams.

Note: The original io.js README.md is temporarily renamed to iojs_README.md.
