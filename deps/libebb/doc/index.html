    <h1>libebb</h1>

    <p>
      libebb is a lightweight HTTP server library for C.  It lays the
      foundation for writing a web server by providing the socket juggling
      and request parsing. By implementing the HTTP/1.1 grammar provided in
      RFC2612,  libebb understands most most valid HTTP/1.1 connections
      (persistent, pipelined, and chunked requests included) and rejects
      invalid or malicious requests.  libebb supports SSL over HTTP.  
    </p>

    <p>
      The library embraces a minimalistic single-threaded evented design.
      No control is removed from the user. For example, all allocations are
      done through callbacks so that the user might implement in optimal
      ways for their specific application.  By design libebb is not
      thread-safe and all provided callbacks must not block.  libebb uses
      the <a href="http://libev.schmorp.de/bench.html">high-performance</a>
      libev event loop, but does not control it. The user of the library may
      start and stop the loop at will, they may attach thier own watchers. 
    </p>

    <p>
      libebb depends on POSIX sockets, libev, and optionally GnuTLS. 
    </p>

    <p>
      libebb is in the early stages of development and probably contains
      many bugs. The API is subject to radical changes.  If you're
      interested <a href="http://github.com/ry/libebb/tree/master">checkout
        the source code</a> and <a
        href="http://groups.google.com/group/ebbebb">join the mailing
        list</a>.  A release will be made when it proves stable.
    </p>

    <p>libebb is released under <a
      href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#X11License">the
      X11 license</a>.</p>

    <h2>Usage</h2>

    <p>
      libebb is a simple API, mostly it is providing callbacks.  There are
      two types of callbacks that one will work with: 
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>callbacks to allocate and initialize data for libebb. These are
      named <code>new_*</code> like <code>new_connection</code> and
      <code>new_request</code></li>
      <li>callbacks which happen on an event and might provide a pointer to
      a chunk of data. These are named <code>on_*</code> like
      <code>on_body</code> and <code>on_close</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In libebb there are three important classes: <code>ebb_server</code>,
      <code>ebb_connection</code>, and <code>ebb_request</code>. 
      Each server has many peer connections. Each peer connection may have many
      requests.
      There are two additional classes <code>ebb_buf</code> and <code>ebb_request_parser</code>
      which may or may not be useful.
    </p>

    <h3><code>ebb_server</code></h3>
    <p>
      <code>ebb_server</code> represents a single web server listening on a
      single port. The user must allocate the structure themselves, then
      call <code>ebb_server_init()</code> and provide a libev event loop.
      <code>ebb_server_set_secure()</code> will make the server understand
      HTTPS connections.
    </p>

    <p>
      After initialized the <code>ebb_server_listen_on_port()</code> can be
      called to open the server up to new connections. libebb does not
      control the event loop, it is the user's responsibility to start the
      event loop  (using <code>ev_loop()</code>) after
      <code>ebb_server_listen_on_port()</code> is called.
    </p>

    <p>
      To accept connections you must provide the new server with a callback
      called <code>new_connection</code>. This callback must return an allocated
      and initialized <code>ebb_connection</code> structure.     
      To set this callback do
    </p>

    <pre>my_server-&gt;new_connection = my_new_connection_callback;</pre>

    <p>
      Additional documentation can be found in <code>ebb.h</code>
    </p>

    <h3><code>ebb_connection</code></h3>

    <p>
      This structure contains information and callbacks for a single client
      connection. It is allocated and initialized through the
      <code>new_connection</code> callback in <code>ebb_server</code>.
      To initialize a newly allocated <code>ebb_connection</code> use
      <code>ebb_connection_init()</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      After <code>ebb_connection_init()</code> is called a number of
      callbacks can be set: <code>new_request</code>, <code>new_buf</code>,
      <code>on_timeout</code>, and <code>on_close</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      When an <code>ebb_connection</code> is returned to an
      <code>ebb_server</code>, data is immediately data is read from the
      socket.  This data must be stored somewhere. Because libebb is
      agnostic about allocation decisions, it passes this off to the user in
      the form of a callback: <code>connection-&gt;new_buf</code>.  This
      callback returns a newly allocated and initialized
      <code>ebb_buf</code> structure.  How much libebb attempts to read from
      the socket is determined by how large the returned
      <code>ebb_buf</code> structure is.  Using <code>new_buf</code> is
      optional.  By default libebb reads data into a static buffer
      (allocated at compile time), writing over it on each read. In many
      web server using the static buffer will be sufficent because callbacks
      made during the parsing will buffer the data elsewhere. Providing a
      <code>new_buf</code> callback is necessary only if you want to save
      the raw data coming from the socket.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <code>new_request</code> callback is called at the beginning of a
      request. It must return a newly allocated and initialized
      <code>ebb_request</code> structure. Because HTTP/1.1 supports <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_persistent_connection">peristant</a>
      connections, there may be many requests per connection.
    </p>

    <p>
      You may access the file descriptor for the client socket inside the
      <code>ebb_connection</code> structure. Writing the response, in valid
      HTTP, is the user's responsibility.  Remember, requests must be
      returned to client in the same order that they were received.
    </p>

    <p>
      A convience function, <coe>ebb_connection_write</code>, is provided
      which will write a single string to the peer. You may use
      this function or you may write to the file descriptor directly.
    </p>

    <p>
      To close a peer connection use
      <code>ebb_connnection_schedule_close()</code>. Because SSL may require
      some additional communication to close the connection properly, the
      file descriptor cannot be closed immediately. The
      <code>on_close</code> callback will be made when the peer socket is
      finally closed. 
      <em>Only once <code>on_close</code> is called may the
        user free the <code>ebb_connection</code> structure.</em> 
    </p>


    <h3><code>ebb_request</code></h3>

    <p>
      This structure provides information about a request. For example,
      <code>request-&gt;method == EBB_POST</code> would mean the method of
      the request is <code>POST</code>. There are also many callbacks
      which can be set to handle data from a request as it is parsed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <code>on_uri</code> callback and all other
      <code>ebb_element_cb</code> callbacks provide pointers to request
      data.  The annoying thing is they do not necessarily provide a
      complete string.  This is because the reads from the socket may not
      contain an entire request and for efficency libebb does not attempt to
      buffer the data.  Theoretically, one might receive an
      <code>on_uri</code> callback 10 times, each providing just a single
      character of the request's URI.  See <code>ebb_request_parser.h</code> for
      a full list of callbacks that you may provide. (If you don't set them,
      they are ignored.)
    </p>

    <p>
      The <code>on_complete</code> callback is called at the end of
      each request.
      <em>Only once <code>on_complete</code> is called may the
        user free the <code>ebb_request</code> structure.</em> 
    </p>
