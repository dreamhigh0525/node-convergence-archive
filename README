WHEREAS, Servers organized around event loops are more efficent; and

WHEREAS, The usage of threads has complicated computer programming; and

WHEREAS, Most operating systems do not provide asynchonous file system access.

WHEREAS, Javascript is a language without a concept of I/O or threads; and

WHEREAS, Users familar with using Javascript in the web browser already program using events and callbacks; and

WHEREAS, The V8 javascript comes free of I/O and threads; and

WHEREAS, The V8 javascript compiles Javascript code directly to Assembler; and

WHEREAS, The libev event loop abstraction provides access to the best event loop interface on each system.
