- fix tests for NODE_MODULE_CONTEXTS=1
- readline
  - fix for two column glyphs. use Markus Kuhn's wcwidth.c
  - fix for commands that extend beyond term width
- SSL should be factored out of net.js into standalone stream object
- add completion callbacks to all stream write() methods
- Erradicate all traces of 'binary' encoding. Only used, now, in OpenSSL
  binding.
- Documentation needs a major refactor; should generate more than one HTML
  page/man page from the single api.markdown file. Deep sections should be
  allowed.
- debug and production modes
- EventSource branch merged
- TCP servers should have an optional number of maximum connections. When
  the maximum is reached it stops accepting new connections.
- compile under clang
- Use C++ style casts everywhere.
- fs.readFile[Sync] should not call stat() and use the length. 
  Test on Linux's /proc/sys/kernel/hostname
- Ruby-like Process#detach (is that possible?)
- stderr isn't flushing on exit
- ReadStream should not use an offset in calls to fs.read
  (so that it can pull in files larger than 2G)
- fs.readFile and fs.readFileSync need to not stat and prealloc a buffer 
  based on size but rather read until EOF into a chain of buffers, then 
  concat them together.
- process object should be defined in src/node.js not in c++
