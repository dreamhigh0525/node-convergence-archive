  - fix for two column glyphs. use Markus Kuhn's wcwidth.c
  - fix for commands that extend beyond term width
- SSL should be factored out of net.js into standalone stream object
- add completion callbacks to all stream write() methods
- Erradicate all traces of 'binary' encoding. Only used, now, in OpenSSL
  binding.

  allowed.
- EventSource branch merged
- Use C++ style casts everywhere.
- Ruby-like Process#detach (is that possible?)
- stderr isn't flushing on exit
- ReadStream should not use an offset in calls to fs.read

- fs.readFile and fs.readFileSync need to not stat and prealloc a buffer 
  based on size but rather read until EOF into a chain of buffers, then 
  concat them together.
- process object should be defined in src/node.js not in c++
- Test for EMFILE accept spin bug.
