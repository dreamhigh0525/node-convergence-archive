- ARGV

- jslint integration. compile it into the node binary and run it
  automatically on each execution.

- signal handlers. 

- stdin, stdout, stderr. Accessing these with read()/write() blocks.
  They cannot be select()ed. They are always readable. Thus all access
  to them needs to be done in a thread pool. (E.G. oi_file_open_stdin())
